## 🧩 Detailed Bug Analysis and Fixes

### 🐛 B-001 — Dataset Loading Failure
**Symptom:**  
The dashboard stopped execution when `cleaned_weather.csv` wasn’t found in the expected path.

**Cause:**  
Hardcoded file path dependency caused failure when directory structure changed.

**Fix:**  
Added flexible file search across multiple directories:
```python
for f in ["processed/cleaned_weather.csv", "cleaned_weather.csv", "data/cleaned_weather.csv"]:
    if os.path.exists(f):
        return pd.read_csv(f)
