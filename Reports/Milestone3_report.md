🌤️ Milestone 3 — Visualization Development & Interactivity
🎯 Objective

The aim of Milestone 3 was to bring the cleaned and analyzed data from the earlier milestones together into one interactive, professional-grade climate analytics dashboard.

This dashboard, called Infosys ClimateScope Light Pro, enables users to visualize global weather trends, analyze climate insights, and interact with live environmental metrics — all in one elegant and user-friendly platform. 🌍💡

🧩 Key Goals

✨ This milestone focused on:

🌦️ Integrating the cleaned dataset from Milestone 1

📊 Visualizing all insights explored in Milestone 2

🖥️ Developing a multi-tab interactive dashboard with filters, maps, and KPIs

🎨 Designing a light-themed UI with dark, bold charts for contrast

💾 Providing options to export data and summaries dynamically

⚙️ Tech Stack
Category	Tools / Libraries
🐍 Programming Language	Python 3
🧮 Data Handling	pandas • numpy
📊 Visualization	Plotly Express • Plotly Graph Objects
🖼️ Dashboard Framework	Streamlit
💾 Storage	CSV (Processed Data)
🎨 Styling	HTML + CSS (Light Theme Design)
🌈 Design Concept

The dashboard follows a modern, minimalistic design —
🌤️ a soft white + blue gradient background with subtle shadows, rounded cards, and dark-colored charts for clarity.

Each element — from buttons to KPI panels — was crafted to look professional and readable, giving the entire platform a real-time analytics feel.

🗂️ Dashboard Structure

The final interactive dashboard includes six smart tabs, each focused on a different aspect of global climate analysis.

Tab	Description & Visualizations
📊 Overview	Displays temperature trends, humidity levels, and pressure vs wind speed comparisons using interactive line and bar charts.
🌍 Geo Map	Visualizes global distribution of climate data on a world map. Countries are highlighted by selected metrics such as temperature, humidity, or precipitation.
💨 Air Quality	Showcases PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂, SO₂, and O₃ levels using vivid bar charts and a correlation heatmap to explore relationships between pollutants.
☁️ Weather Conditions	Represents frequency of weather conditions (like Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy) with animated pie charts and scatter plots linking cloud cover and humidity.
📈 Correlations	Displays an interactive correlation matrix of all numeric variables along with a full statistical summary for deeper data insights.
📅 Sunrise & Sunset	Offers histograms that reveal how sunrise and sunset times vary across different countries and months.
💎 User Interactivity Features

✨ The dashboard offers a seamless interactive experience through:

🧭 Sidebar Filters — select countries, metrics, and date ranges

📆 Dynamic Date Sliders — filter data by periods to see climate changes over time

🧮 Auto-updating KPI cards — display real-time averages, maximums, and minimums

📊 Responsive Charts — zoom in, hover, and compare values live

💾 Export Buttons — download filtered datasets and summary reports instantly

📈 Highlights & Insights

🔹 Regional Patterns — Clear visualization of how temperature and humidity vary across continents.
🔹 Seasonal Trends — Interactive charts reveal temperature rises and drops month by month.
🔹 Air Quality Analysis — Correlation heatmaps show how different pollutants affect each other.
🔹 Weather Distribution — Pie charts show the dominant weather types across regions.
🔹 Sunrise/Sunset Behavior — Distinct daylight patterns across countries and seasons.
