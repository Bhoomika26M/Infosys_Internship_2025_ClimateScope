# Milestone 2 — Core Analysis & Visualization Design

**Project:** ClimateScope — Visualizing Global Weather Trends and Extreme Events  
**Author:** Thesika S N

## Objective
To perform detailed statistical and exploratory data analysis on the Global Weather Repository dataset and design interactive visualizations for the ClimateScope dashboard.

## Key Tasks Completed
- Performed statistical analysis to identify distributions, correlations and variability among key parameters (temperature, humidity, wind, pressure).
- Detected seasonal patterns and temporal trends using time-series and monthly analyses.
- Implemented visualization types:
  - Histograms for temperature and wind distributions.
  - Line charts for temporal trends across regions.
  - Box plots for monthly variations.
  - Heatmaps for correlation insights.
  - Choropleth maps for regional temperature visualization.
- Built an interactive Streamlit dashboard with filters (country, date range) for dynamic exploration.
- Designed base layout and navigation for a multi-page dashboard.

## Insights & Findings
- Strong seasonal temperature cycles are visible in many regions.
- A negative relationship between temperature and humidity appears in several climate zones.
- Wind and precipitation vary significantly across coastal and continental regions.
- Outliers and potential climate anomalies were identified for further study.

## Deliverables
- `cleaned_weather.csv` (cleaned dataset)
- `data_preparation.py`
- Streamlit dashboard: `app.py` (Milestone 2 version)
- Summary reports: `stats_descriptive.csv`, `stats_correlation.csv`
