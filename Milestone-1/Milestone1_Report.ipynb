    "# ClimateScope – Data Cleaning & Preparation Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The goal of this data preparation stage was to convert the raw Global Climate Repository dataset into a clean, structured, analysis-ready format that can be used for exploratory analysis, dashboard visualization, correlation studies, and later machine learning modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Data Cleaning Steps Performed\n",
    "\n",
    "| Cleaning Step | Description | Output Result |\n",
    "|---------------|-------------|---------------|\n",
    "| Missing Value Check | Identified missing / null records across all weather variables | Null distribution verified and handled |\n",
    "| Date Formatting | Converted date columns to proper datetime type for time-series analysis | Enabled month, day, seasonal level analytics |\n",
    "| Removing Duplicates | Checked for duplicate rows based on location + date | Removed duplicate records (ensures accuracy) |\n",
    "| Type Casting | Converted numeric columns (temp, humidity, wind, precip, pollutants) to float/int | Standardized formats for statistical ops |\n",
    "| Outlier Handling | Extreme values treated based on IQR / STD rules | Reduced false spike influence |\n",
    "| New Feature Creation | Extracted month, day, season, indicators | Enabled seasonal / month-wise dashboard sections |\n",
    "| Column Renaming | Standardized column naming style | Consistency across dashboard + ML stage |\n",
    "| Final Sanity Validation | Final structure, row count, data shape verified | Final dataset exported successfully |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Cleaned Columns Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- Location Details (Country, City, Coordinates)\n",
    "- Core Climate Measures (Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Wind Speed)\n",
    "- Precipitation Metrics\n",
    "- Air Quality Pollutants (PM2.5 + others)\n",
    "- Lunar / Astronomical fields (Moon illumination, sunrise, sunset)\n",
    "- Temporal Features (Month, Day, Season)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Cleaning Was Important\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removes noise & faulty values  \n",
    "- Prevents wrong interpretations in visualization  \n",
    "- Improves reliability of statistical calculations  \n",
    "- Supports accurate clustering / modeling in next milestone  \n",
    "\n",

    "## Final Output Produced\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CleanedWeatherRepository.csv**  \n",
    "- **CleanedWeatherRepositoryDaily.csv**\n",
    "- **CleanedWeatherRepositoryMonthly.csv**\n",
    "\n",
    "These files are the base input datasets used in the ClimateScope Dashboard generation stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This data cleaning pipeline successfully transformed raw multi-variable climate data into a reliable standardized dataset.  \n",
    "This ensures that all subsequent analysis, dashboards, insights  are built over **validated**, **consistent**, and **trustworthy** climate information.\n"
